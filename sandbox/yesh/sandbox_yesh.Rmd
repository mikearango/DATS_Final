# Cleaning
  1. Drop Variables that are useless
  2. drop 3 outliers (see above scatter plot) --> partial sales
    
# Questions
  * Can we do unsupervised learning with categorical variables? How does PCA work with categorical variables (MS.Subclass, MS.Zoning, Street, etc.)
  * Predict the price of homes
  * Predict what neighborhood in town the home is based on sale price and other factors (KNN)
