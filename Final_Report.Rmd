# Intro

The 2008 financial crisis affected the lives of everyone in the United States---some more than others---and there is an abundance of retrospective research that seeks to identify which sectors of the economy were hit hardest during this time and why. The first sector that comes to mind is housing as the financial crisis was "characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and the resulting decline of securities" backed by these subprime mortgages.[1] For this reason, we decided to use our multifaceted data science toolbox to answer meaningful questions about the housing market. The goal of this project is ultimately to build a regression model to predict defined outcomes. So, while we will not be analyzing the housing market from an economic perspective like the majority of the literature, we can offer up a predictive model for academic purposes. 

As a conceptual framework for our research, we adopted Peng and Matsui's epicycles of analysis to iteratively manage the steps of our data analysis.[2] After choosing the broad topic of the housing market, we narrowed the scope of our research. This included brainstorming as a team to figure out what specific question we wanted to answer about the housing market. We unanimously decided to predict the sale price of a residential house sale based on common characteristics that a property appraiser or assessor's office would use to assess property value.

## The Dataset

The dataset we chose for our project contains information from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office on residential property sales that occurred in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.[3] The dataset was published in the *Journal of Statistics Education* for students and researchers alike to have an opportunity to practice predictive modeling on messy, real world data. The dataset contains 2930 observations of 80 variables and the unit of observation is a single property sale in Ames, Iowa in a given year.

Of the 80 variables, 23 are nominal, 23 are ordinal, 14 are discrete, and 20 are continuous. The variables included are basic characteristics that anyone wanting to buy a house would be interested in. For the most part, the different variables may be split up into specific groups. In general, the 20 continuous variables relate to  measurements of area dimensions for each observation. These include, among others, the sizes of lots, rooms, porches, and garages. The 14 discrete variables mostly have to do with the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, etc. that a given property has. There are several geographic categorical variables that start profiling properties at the individual Parcel ID level and end at the neighborhood level. The rest of the nominal variables identify characteristics of the property and dwelling type/structure. Most of the ordinal variables are rankings of the quality/condition of rooms and lot characteristics. For more information on the variables in the dataset, consult the included `DataDescription.txt` file.
